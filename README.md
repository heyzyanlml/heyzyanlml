# Hello, World! I'm Zyan 👋

## About Me
Hey there! I'm Zyanya, but everyone calls me Zyan (short and sweet, right?). Currently, I'm on a journey of web development, juggling a bootcamp and some good old self-teaching. My main areas of focus are JavaScript and React. Why? Because I find that creating sleek, user-friendly websites is a fun puzzle to solve—and hey, I love a good challenge. 💻✨

Thanks to my background in Marketing, I've realized just how much a not-so-great website can throw a wrench into the user experience. Whether it’s confusing navigation, slow load times, or those annoying buttons that never seem to work (we've all been there), it can really ruin the moment. My mission is to learn how to prevent those tragedies from happening and create smooth, enjoyable experiences for users. 🚀🚀

The tech world has been a thrilling adventure for me—though I won’t lie, it hasn’t always been smooth sailing (or coding, in this case). Before jumping into this, I didn’t have much experience with programming. But every step forward, every new concept learned, just gets me more hyped to keep exploring and leveling up my skills. 🌱

## My Projects
So far, I've developed some neat little projects using HTML and CSS, and I’m currently working on a project where I’m mixing HTML, CSS, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and React. Yup, it’s as fun as it sounds! 🎨 I’m still on my learning path, but I’m actively looking for **internships, trainee positions, or junior roles** at a tech company. I'm excited to apply what I’ve learned in real-world settings and, of course, continue expanding my knowledge. 💡

## When I'm Not Coding...
When I'm not glued to my screen working on the next big thing (or at least trying to get that one pesky bug out of my code 🐛), I’m usually rolling through the streets on my skates 🛼, embroidering (it’s surprisingly zen 🧵), biking around 🚴‍♀️, or binge-watching whatever series has me hooked that week. Oh, and I’m also a big fan of **Overcooked**. I like to think that if I can handle the chaos of virtual kitchens with my friends, I can handle just about anything. Multitasking under pressure? Check. 😉✅

## What’s Next?
I’m all about continuous learning 📚 and pushing myself to new heights. In the near future, I’m aiming to step into the tech world with an internship, trainee, or junior position. I'm super excited to contribute to real-world projects, apply everything I’ve learned, and, of course, keep learning (because the world of tech never stops, does it?). 🚀

## Let's Collaborate!
Got a project idea? 💡 Want to team up on something exciting? ⚡ Need a partner to brave the chaos of **Overcooked** with? 🍳 You can totally count on me for the last one—seriously, I’m excellent at yelling "on your left!" when things get hectic. But for real, I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations, especially if they involve tech, UX, or just making cool stuff happen. 🎉
